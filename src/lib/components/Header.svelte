  <h1>The Living Library of Trees</h1>
  <p>
    The project visualizes the intertwined histories of plants and experts at
    the Arnold Arboretum. Drawing on centuries of archival material, the project
    combines close reading with deep learning to explore how knowledge has
    circulated through this living museum. By mapping the interconnected
    biographies of trees and curators, the interactive platform invites
    audiences to find their own path through the Arboretum and discover stories
    of infrastructure, care, and interspecies affinities.
